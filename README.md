# DigCompEdu
This is the repo for Mahara Smart Evidence Framework modeling the European Framework for the Digital Competences of Educators (DigCompEdu). This framework is created from a slight Bremish perspective (I work in teacher education at U Bremen), but before all of you fork your versions it could be good to join forces and agree on a more general model. Therefore it would be nice to have translated versions for the Mahara community.

**What are the "slight Bremish perspective?**

In Germany there is a rich tradition of critical media education (Medienbildung, to be more precise). This perspective is lacking in DigCompEdu. Also for teacher education at university level, the framework is missing a scientific and theoretical level. Therefore we added a seventh "dimension" called "Scientific foundations".
